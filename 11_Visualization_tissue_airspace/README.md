This module allows to assemble a visualization of the ROI defined in previous steps (i.e., parenchyma, border, air ducts, air ducts walls, fibrosis, and airspace) over the original image.

Briefly, the visualization of tissue image (i.e., output of module 9) is duplicated, and the airspace is highlighted.

Output consists of: (1) RGB image of the sample with ROI highlighted. 1
