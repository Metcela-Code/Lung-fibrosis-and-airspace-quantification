This module allows to detect the airspace in the parenchyma of the sample. It can be applied irrespectively of the staining used.

Briefly, the parenchyma is duplicated, and virtually closed by the pleura and air ducts walls previously defined. The airspace is defined as the negative space in the parenchyma. Particles are filtered by size and circularity.

Output consists of: (1) mask of ROI, (2) overlay of ROI over original image, (3) ROI file, (4) measurements (area and perimeter) of all selected particles, (5) summary of measurements (area and perimeter) of all selected particles, and (6) settings (input file name, minimum particle size, maximum particle size, minimum particle circularity, maximum particle circularity, and number of selected particles).
