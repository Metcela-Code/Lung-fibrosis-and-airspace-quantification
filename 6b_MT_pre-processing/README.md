This module allows to separate the connective tissue, the cytoplasm, and the nuclei in the image of the parenchyma. It is based on the color deconvolution of Masson’s trichrome staining.

Briefly, the image is duplicated, and the “Colour Deconvolution” plugin (https://imagej.net/plugins/colour-deconvolution; pre-installed in Fiji) is applied.

Output consists of: (1) RGB image of the connective tissue in the parenchyma, (2) RGB image of the cytoplasm in the parenchyma, and (3) RGB image of the nuclei in the parenchyma.
