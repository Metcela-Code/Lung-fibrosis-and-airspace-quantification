This module allows to define the air ducts. It is based on a manual identification of anatomical structures over a binary mask (e.g., output of module 2b).

Briefly, the image is duplicated and anatomical structures are identified by the user. A visualization is assembled in real-time.

Output consists of: (1) overlay of ROI over original mask, and (2) ROI file. 1
